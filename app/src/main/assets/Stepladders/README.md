This uses only d3.js for everything. No jQuery, a small bit of direct DOM interaction is used for HTML buttons and text messages.

It should work well on almost any modern browser. It plays well on my Android cell phone with very minimal changes for responsive design. The SVG resizes itself to fit in the space.

Change #1: Used callback function for hops so that the end game message doesn't happen before hop is complete. The game now randomly picks which player starts first. Autosizing is improved.

Screen now  re-renders without disturbing the game play when browser is resized. It should even re-render properly during a play.

Change 2: Adds more snaky snakes. I did some work with rotated tangents to the snake and used a seeded random generator to get consistent but not exactly predictable looking snakes. The positions of the snakes can be controlled more precisely as well. I learned how to connect separate paths generated by d3.js interpolators into a closed curve.
