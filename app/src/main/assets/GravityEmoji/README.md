I was curious of if it was possible to create a game using Emoji (font) for graphics. That is, a game with graphics – that doesn't load any! So I started with my old 1k JS game "Gravity" and started replacing minimalist canvas shapes with playful emoji's. There were some challenges in development however; like iOS having 16px max size, no colors on Windows < 10, different rotations on spaceships and general lack of support.  

Fun side-effects of using Emoji are that graphics looks different on almost all platforms and total gzipped load of the game is around 3kiloBytes.
